# Connect Caju Documentation

## Overview

Connect Caju is a transformative project aimed at digitizing the cashew value chain in Mozambique. It encompasses the entire journey of cashew nuts from planting to processing and exportation. This initiative is designed to streamline the tracking and management of cashew nuts, ensuring transparency and efficiency in the cashew value chain.

## Key Features

- **Actor Registration:** Registers various actors within the cashew value chain, including cashew farmers, traders, processors, exporters, cooperatives, and associations.
- **Tracking Movement:** Facilitates the registration of cashew nuts being transported from one point to another within the country, enabling users to track the origin and destination of each volume of cashew nuts.

## Target Audience

The primary users of Connect Caju are extension agents and fiscals who play a crucial role in overseeing and facilitating the cashew value chain processes.
